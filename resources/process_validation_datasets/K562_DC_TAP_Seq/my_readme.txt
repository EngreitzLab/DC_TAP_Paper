The Crop.design.txt file was copied from Evvie's directory

The bed file with positive controls was copied from Evvie's directory

Old guide targets was a file that Evvie gave to me a while back


Except the Crop.design.txt file,
I believe all of these should get remade or redone by adding the screen design code to the pipeline


The even older guide targets file comes before Evvie merged targets that were overlapping. I use this to get the target regions for the promoters. It comes from here: `/oak/stanford/groups/engreitz/Users/jgalante/ENCODE_K562_Validation_Datasets/Combined_Sceptre_Fixed_FDR_01/ENCODE_CRISPR_data/resources/TAPSeq/old_guide_targets.tsv`
