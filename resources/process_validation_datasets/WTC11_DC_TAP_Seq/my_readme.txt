even_older_guide_targets.tsv comes from /oak/stanford/groups/engreitz/Users/jgalante/ENCODE_nonK562_Validation_Datasets/DC_TAP/CRISPRiScreen_w_Sceptre/resources/DC_TAP/old_guide_targets.tsv
where the naming convention comes from the fact that I used a similar "pre-merged" file from Evvie for the K562 DC TAP but "even older" is because in the K562 DC TAP I also used a post-merged old file
