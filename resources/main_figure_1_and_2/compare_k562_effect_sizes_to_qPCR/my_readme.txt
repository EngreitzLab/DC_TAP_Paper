The L-SG-TAP-Whole results were taken from this path in Evvie's directories: /oak/stanford/groups/engreitz/Users/ejagoda/hgrm/220523_high_moi_tap_dc_ampli_tap_pilot/10x_analysis/052322_analysis_L-SG-TAP-Whole
The tar.gz file was unzipped and untarred with "tar -xvzf filtered_feature_bc_matrix.tar.gz", which resulted in the "barcodes", "features", and "matrix" files

qPCR_results.tsv were taken from the following file that Jud sent to me over slack on 3/20/25 in chat with Maddie: https://docs.google.com/file/d/1Wf7nhqC0x7k5VYq954PDq_qzDuGkggUN/edit?usp=docslist_api&filetype=msexcel
I took columns h-k and made a tsv

the extra_qPCR.tsv results were also sent to me by Judhajeet over slack on 3/19/25 (in chat with Maddie). This included the DC TAP effect sizes, but I removed that column and added those effect sizes dynamically based on the effect sizes calculated by the pipeline
